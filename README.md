How does PCBridge work?

PCBridge is waiting shared content from other applications. That is, for example, sharing content to PCBridge with the function “Share” from Twitter or other applications. The shared content is added from other applications so that you can check them later from you PC. You can also add content to PCBridge with the button “Paste from clipboard”. If you want to paste content from clipboard you just need to open PCBridge and select “Paste from Clipboard”.
If you want to damp the shared content to your PC you just need to open your preferred web browser (FireFox, Chrome or Safari) and load the URL showed on the upper side of PCBridge; it is something like “http://192.168.1.105:8585”.

How to use PCBridge:

-Share content from other application with PCBridge: Click on “Share” and select “PCBridge”
-Or share text: Select and copy the text. Open PCBridge and click on “Paste from Clipboard”
-Open the web browser on your PC (FireFox, Chrome or Safari) and write the URL that appears on the upper side of PCBridge. The URL is something like:
“http://192.168.1.105:8585”
-Click on “Connect”. If everything is fine the state will change from DISCONNECTED to CONNECTED and your shared contents will appear on the browser.
-Click on “New shared” to get the list of contents that you shared from you Android
-If the content is or has a link (URL), click on it to open a new tag. If the content is plain text from clipboard you can select it to do with it whatever you wish.
